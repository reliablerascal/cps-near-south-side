            <p>In late September, <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2022/9/28/23377696/chicago-public-schools-board-of-education-near-south-side-high-school-declining-enrollment" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">several</a> <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/09/28/cps-approves-new-120-million-near-south-side-high-school-but-state-rep-vows-to-kill-funding-for-it/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">local</a> <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-public-schools-new-cps-high-school-chinatown-bridgeport/12273453/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">news</a> <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2022/09/28/cps-board-narrowly-approves-steps-furthering-near-south-high-school-plans" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">outlets</a> reported on a Chicago Public Schools board meeting vote narrowly supporting <a href="https://www.cpsboe.org/content/actions/2022_09/22-0928-OP7.pdf?mc_cid=db91a10bf2&amp;mc_eid=1cffc04410" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">acquisition of land intended for a proposed new Near South Side high school</a> costing $120 million. The proposed school has <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/9/26/23373183/near-south-side-high-school-families-students-pat-dowell-nicole-lee-city-council-other-views" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">community champions</a>. But WBEZ <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/a-new-near-south-side-school-wont-harm-neighboring-schools-officials-say-not-everyone-is-convinced/3830db57-53d1-4192-93c2-90770e8ae491" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">cited a confidential memo by top CPS officials</a> concerned that competition from a new school would accelerate the decline of nearby schools, while referencing “deep concerns” expressed by the school district data manager in an internal memo from the previous year. Earlier in September, CPS released annual enrollment data underscoring concerns about <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/9/22/23365886/cps-enrollment-public-school-drop-students-elementary-high" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">systemwide enrollment decline</a>, while the state representative who secured $50 million from the state in support of the school expressed concerns about <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/state-rep-says-shell-block-50-million-for-new-near-south-side-school-until-critical-voices-are-heard/fe4affe6-7b85-4475-841e-6ad10d65e968" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">lack of community input</a> in the planning process.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>With key votes in support of CPS capital funding still ahead, it’s critical to take a closer look at the presumably concerning data. Many factors should be considered, including an analysis of budget, <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-teacher-shortage-u-46-substitute-teachers-special-ed/12131501/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">teacher availability</a>, and access to school programming such as population-specific language offerings. My own analysis (see my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q4todPQxuudo4JAZ3zNCxmPDeYSm0rqkObhaiA4a-TU/edit?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">dataset</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UYVkEB-VHMWBWREOdJ7LQrdMBI-Sy8WFWaoijZTg4dw/edit?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">presentation on investigation process</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KUacylyUaOHD-9wlmE5NnHCCas6ox0XpjLBYtTMh0_g/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">data journal</a>) focuses more narrowly on enrollment in an attempt to illuminate the geographical component of the story: where would students for a proposed new school come from? This analysis, in conjunction with more targeted conversations with local stakeholders, could advance an investigation of the proposed new school’s potential impact on existing schools.</p>

Note that CPS defines “underutilized” as under 70% of ideal capacity. Tilden, Phillips, and Wells range between 11% to 36% utilization.</p>

This could help illuminate whether trends in the local CPS elementary school-aged population point to a need for future capacity at local high schools.</p>

    <p>These analyses raise some interesting questions. Related to graphic #2 above:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>Tilden's enrollment has rebounded 20% (adding 36 students) in the past year, bucking a trend of <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2019/5/2/21108146/chicago-is-throwing-its-smallest-high-schools-a-lifeline-but-is-it-enough" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">enrollment decline amongst small schools</a>. What factors are causing this, and could it provide lessons for enrollment recovery?</li>
    
    
    
    <li>What would make these existing high schools more appealing?</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p>Related to graphic #4 above:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>Is elementary school enrollment truly reflective of high school enrollment potential, or could the new school potentially attract high school aged students who had never been in CPS? To get a sense of broader demographics outside of CPS I built a <a href="https://censusreporter.org/user_geo/caecfa17f7ec5e6c446e29851760d175/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">block assignment file</a> for the school boundaries as a first step in anchoring the demographic analysis to 2020 census data.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>Given the slightly increasing enrollment at National Teachers Academy elementary school, did <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/national-teachers-academy-chicago-schools-school-closing-public/4823125/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">2018 discussions about converting this existing school to a high school</a> have merit compared to the current proposal for a new building?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Schools chief Pedro Martinez is on the record as promising <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/cps-advances-plans-for-near-south-high-school-despite-opposition-threat-to-withhold-state-funding/175049af-0cef-4f27-882e-7537e2648929" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer"><strong><em>both</em></strong> an investment in the existing schools <strong><em>and</em></strong> a new school</a>:</p>
    
    
    
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p>“People have talked about this as an 'or,'' so either you build a new school or invest in old schools,” Martinez said. “I’ve never seen this as an ‘or.’ For me, it’s always been an ‘and.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    
    
    <p>What, concretely, will CPS offer to Tilden, Dunbar, and Wells? What do these schools need to succeed?</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I've assembled a list of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHbOGF44DnSR7eWaL46abB0LG44iH48hoZdlCVkvfxs/edit#gid=0" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">Local School Council members at the three schools</a> and believe that interviews with community members, parents, staff, and students in these groups would bring more context to the data and elevate past and current advocacy efforts made on behalf of the declining schools in the Near South Side area.</p>
