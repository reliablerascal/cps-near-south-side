The proposed school has <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/9/26/23373183/near-south-side-high-school-families-students-pat-dowell-nicole-lee-city-council-other-views" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">community champions</a>.</p>
      
    <p>But WBEZ <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/a-new-near-south-side-school-wont-harm-neighboring-schools-officials-say-not-everyone-is-convinced/3830db57-53d1-4192-93c2-90770e8ae491" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">cited a confidential memo by top CPS officials</a> concerned that competition from a new school would accelerate the decline of nearby schools, while referencing “deep concerns” expressed by the school district data manager in an internal memo from the previous year. CPS recently released annual enrollment data underscoring concerns about <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/9/22/23365886/cps-enrollment-public-school-drop-students-elementary-high" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">systemwide enrollment decline</a>, while the state representative who secured $50 million from the state in support of the school worried about <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/state-rep-says-shell-block-50-million-for-new-near-south-side-school-until-critical-voices-are-heard/fe4affe6-7b85-4475-841e-6ad10d65e968" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" aria-expanded="false">lack of community input</a> in the planning process.</p>
    
    <p>Many factors should be considered in planning a new school, including budget, <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-teacher-shortage-u-46-substitute-teachers-special-ed/12131501/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">teacher availability</a>, and access to school programming such as population-specific language offerings.</p>
      
    <p>But a closer look at enrollment trends seems to undermine the case for the new school. Specifically, the three neighboring high schools are operating at a fraction of their capacity with enrollment trending downward at two of them, while enrollment is also trending downward at seven of the nine elementary schools that would serve as feeders.</p>

    <p>Looking at year over year change in CPS enrollment by community area shows declining enrollment in most areas of the city.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container2"><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kx6x8/1/" target="_blank">
    <iframe title="% Change in CPS Enrollment by Community Area" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-kx6x8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kx6x8/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="627" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></a>
    </div>
    
    
    <p></p>
    
    
    
    <p>For Tilden, Phillips, and Wells&mdash; the three open enrollment high schools with boundaries overlapping the proposed new school's <a href="https://www.cpsboe.org/content/documents/near_south_high_school.pdf" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer"> boundaries</a>&mdash; five-year enrollment has declined significantly since the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year.</p>

    <div class="image-container2"><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f2tuP/4/" target="_blank">
      <iframe title="5-Year Enrollment Trend for CPS High Schools Overlapping Proposed Near South Side School" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-f2tuP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f2tuP/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="910"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></a>
    </div>

    <p>Complicating the picture a bit, Tilden has shown a rebound in enrollment in the past year (adding 36 students) despite the overall downward trend over five years.</p>
    <div class="image-container2"><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jVe2o/2/" target="_blank">
      <iframe title="1-Year Enrollment Trend for CPS High Schools Overlapping Proposed Near South Side School" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-jVe2o" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jVe2o/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="910"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
      </script></a>
      </div>
    

      <p>Still, Tilden is operating at only <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11589328/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">11% of its ideal capacity</a>, as measured by CPS’s <a href="?https://www.cps.edu/globalassets/cps-pages/services-and-supports/school-facilities/facilities-standards/space-use-sy2122.xlsx" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">2021-22 Space Utilization report</a>. By CPS's own definition of “underutilized” as under 70% of ideal capacity, all three neighboring schools are underutilized.</p>

      <p>It's worth looking at enrollment at neighboring elementary schools as an indicator of future enrollment potential for the high schools. While 5-year enrollment is trending slightly up for South Loop Elementary and National Teachers Academy, it's <a href="?https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11631905/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">trending sharply down for the other seven schools</a>. This does not seem to point to full utilization of existing high schools any time soon, let alone the need for a new school.</p>

    <p>The new school proposal seems out of step with the declining enrollment trends and raises some questions. Is there more to the story of Tilden's enrollment rebound amidst <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2019/5/2/21108146/chicago-is-throwing-its-smallest-high-schools-a-lifeline-but-is-it-enough" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">enrollment decline amongst small schools</a>? Could the new school potentially attract high school aged students who had never been in CPS? What demographic trends do we see from Census data (I built a <a href="https://censusreporter.org/user_geo/caecfa17f7ec5e6c446e29851760d175/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">block assignment file</a> for the school boundaries as a first step in anchoring the demographic analysis to 2020 census data)?

    As an alternative, what else could CPS do to improve educational offerings in the Near South Side besides build a new school? Given the slightly increasing enrollment at National Teachers Academy elementary school, did <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/national-teachers-academy-chicago-schools-school-closing-public/4823125/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">2018 discussions about converting this existing school to a high school</a> have merit compared to the current proposal for a new building? What else would make the existing high schools appealing to more students?
    
    <p>Schools chief Pedro Martinez is on the record as promising <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/cps-advances-plans-for-near-south-high-school-despite-opposition-threat-to-withhold-state-funding/175049af-0cef-4f27-882e-7537e2648929" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer"><strong><em>both</em></strong> an investment in the existing schools <strong><em>and</em></strong> a new school</a>.</p>
    
    <p>“People have talked about this as an 'or,'' so either you build a new school or invest in old schools,” Martinez said. “I've never seen this as an 'or.'' For me, it's always been an 'and.'</p>
    
    <p>What, concretely, will CPS offer to Tilden, Dunbar, and Wells? What do these existing schools need to succeed?</p>
